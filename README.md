# Letter-Inventory

This is the repository for Lab 3 in WCC's CS 145 class. 
I am using Eclipse to program in C ++. This is my first C++ program.
To begin I watched this video on Object Oriented Programing and Header Files in C ++ 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie282UTAGxg 

The code from this video can be found in the OOP Example file. I am using this as reference material for my own program, although I will not be needing the object file itself. Rather I made my manager class the header file.
